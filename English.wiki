:state-vs-status:

    Ok, I'll tell you my two cents:
    a state is any condition which is durable or lasting (Zustand, Istzustand) 
    whereas a status is a classification of state among several well-defined possibilities.
    An immigrant's status is either legal or illegal, and if he is the latter,
    he may be in an anxious emotional state.
