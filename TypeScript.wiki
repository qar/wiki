https://github.com/Lemoncode/lcFormValidation/commit/ee2b9d739ef5a61d68dbcb37ebea8c35a717a69e

TS2304: Cannot find name 'Map'.
Solution: install `@types/core-js@0.9.36`


Errors like:
error TS2687: All declarations of 'value' must have identical modifiers.
error TS2687: All declarations of 'prototype' must have identical modifiers.
error TS2344: Type 'K' does not satisfy the constraint 'object'.
error TS2687: All declarations of '[Symbol.toStringTag]' must have identical modifiers.
Solution:  in tsconfig.json
change
```
    "lib": [ "es2015", "dom" ],
    "types": [
      "core-js"
    ],
```
to
```
    "lib": [ "es5", "dom" ],
    "types": [
      "core-js"
    ],
```
```
Because: core-js and es6 both are providing es6 type definitions and they're conflicting

```
